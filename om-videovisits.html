				<p class="description">One of my favorite features that I designed at One Medical is Video Visits. It's a fast and convenient way to get care for acute clinical issues that don't require an in-office visit to the doctors - issues such as cold, flu, nausea, skin issues, etc.</p>

			<p class="description">I designed the Android experience, and worked on most aspects of the iOS experience for Video Visits. I worked closely with Engineers early in the process to evaluate various options for how we handle a few of the Video Visit states so that tradeoffs could be made early in the design process. As patients used Video Visits, we used a combination of quantitative data and qualitative feedback to make incremental iterations for a better experience. 
			<br><br>The first version of Video Visits intro experience showed three images at random of three of our providers each time the screen loaded. There were other options explored, but ultimately, this option was the one that conveyed the most sense of trust and quality clinical care. However, we found that users were under the impression that one of the three providers that they saw in the intro state, would answer the video call. I solved for this by designing and prototyping an animation where the images would rotate on the screen. I used FramerJS to do this - using CoffeeScript to code it. The final interaction that's in production has the images transitioning in and transitioning out with a subtle fade. Below is a recording of the prototype that I built:</p>

			<p class="description">>From a user perspective, members are able to get care quicker and more conveniently with Video Visits. From a business perspective, it reduces the amount of patients using office visit slots for issues that are minor so patients with more serious issues can visit their medical provider. Video Visits also directly tied into another project that I worked on: <a href="om-officevisitbooking.html">Integrated Booking Flow.</p>

			<p class="description">When Video Visits first rolled out, we used quantitative data to track the percent of users that were canceling their Video Visit. Because we didn't yet capture the cancel reason in the first version, we didn't know exactly why so many users were canceling their calls before getting through since the metrics showed the average cancel time within minutes of requesting a call. With qualitative feedback, we were able to craft the entire story where we found that although the actual wait time wasn't significant, the perceived wait time felt too long. Put in another way, waiting 1 minute on a digital platform for something to happen ends up *feeling* like 10 minutes. Once the cancel reason screen was pushed to production, we were able to validate that the original hypothesis about the perceived wait time feeling too long was true. To solve for this, I designed a timer to the first waiting state when a user is waiting to be matched with a medical provider, and a failed state to account for users that are waiting longer than our stated SLA. You can see those screens below, along with the cancel reason experience.
