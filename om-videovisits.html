				<p class="description">One of my favorite features that I designed at One Medical is Video Visits. It's a fast and convenient way to get care for acute clinical issues that don't require an in-office visit to the doctors - issues such as cold, flu, nausea, skin issues, etc.</p>
				<p class="description"><strong>Project Goal:</strong> Designing a humane virtual care experience while maintaining trust with the user. </p>
				<p class="description"><strong>My Responsibilities:</strong> Experience definition, Prototype (FramerJS), UI & visual design, research</p>
				<p class="description"><strong>Platforms I designed for:</strong> iOS and Android</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p class="description">For Video Visits, I went wide on explorations and worked closely with Engineers early in the process to evaluate various options for how we handle a few of the Video Visit states so tradeoffs could be made earlier in the design process. As patients used Video Visits, we used a combination of quantitative data and qualitative feedback to make incremental iterations for a better experience.</p> 
			<h2>Learnings and Iterations After Rollout</h2>
			<p class="description">The first version of Video Visits intro experience showed three images at random of three of our providers each time the screen loaded. There were other options explored, but ultimately, this option was the one that conveyed the most sense of trust. However, we found that users were under the impression that one of the three providers they saw in the intro state, would answer the video call. I solved for this by designing and prototyping an animation where the images would rotate on the screen. I used FramerJS to do this - using CoffeeScript to code the subtle animations and transitions. Below is a recording of the prototype that I built:</p>

			<p class="description">From a user perspective, members are able to get care quicker and more conveniently with Video Visits. From a business perspective, it reduces the amount of patients using office visit slots for issues that are minor so patients with more serious issues can visit their medical provider. Video Visits also directly tied into another project that I worked on: <a href="om-officevisitbooking.html">Integrated Booking Flow.</a></p>

			<h2>Design Iteration: A Story Told Through Data</h2>
			<p class="description">Once Video Visits rolled out, I worked with the data team to track the percent of users canceling their request. When we looked at the data, we saw that the average cancel time was within mere minutes of requesting a call. With qualitative feedback in the form of user research, we were able to learn the entire story where we found that the perceived wait time felt too long even though 90% of the requests were being answered within 5 minutes. Put another way, waiting 1 minute on a digital platform for something to happen ends up *feeling* like 10 minutes. 
			<br><br>Once the cancel reason screen was pushed to production, we validated that the original hypothesis on perceived wait time feeling too long held true. I came up with a couple of solutions to address this problem. The solution delivered and cancel reason screen can be viewed below:</p>
