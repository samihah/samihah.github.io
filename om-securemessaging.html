				<h1 id="projecttitle"><b>One Medical | Messaging</b></h1>
				<p class="description">I joined One Medical as a product designer on the consumer-facing team crafting thoughtful experiences for iOS, Android, and web. One of the first projects I worked on when I joined was messaging.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="work"><img src="images/home-securemessaging.png"></div>
			<p class="description">I started the project by doing a deep dive on researching current consumer behavior on communicating clinical information to and from their doctors. I used the research to run a bodystorming exercise with a few teammates that helped expose a few serious holes with one of the directions we were looking at. We then used Slack as a means to prototype one of the approaches. Our learnings from our various creative prototyping sessions led us to create three different interactive prototypes for messaging. I used the prototypes to facilitate a full day of usability research using a video conferencing tool. This helped us learn what worked and what didn't in each of the prototypes.</p>
			<div class="work"><img src="images/om-securemessaging/researchday.png"></div>
			<p class="description">After going through numerous iterations, we split the work of designing the final deliverables between myself and one other designer on the consumer team. I designed the end-to-end experience on web, and I also delivered the Android experience. For iOS, I worked on the next iteration where we found the need to communicate to users if a provider was out of the office. I came up with a couple of options, and delivered the one that best addressed our need to communicate to users the proper SLA when a medical provider is out of the office. 
			<br><br>In addition to web, Android, and iOS, we also needed an email template that could be used to notify users that they have a message waiting for them in the app. I created a few options, along with a few options for copy for subject line when a user views the message in their inbox, and worked with Marketing on ensuring the copy conveyed a sense of trust. Designing with trust in mind, particularly when it comes to health and clinical care, is incredibly important and a core part of the process.
			<br><br>Within a week of launching the new messaging feature to all of our markets, usage went up by about 2000%! And two weeks after that, usage continued growing by 30%! ðŸ¤—</p>
			<div class="work"><img src="images/om-securemessaging/securemessaging-mobile.png"></div>
			<p class="description">The Android platform has its own patterns and conventions that Android users are accustomed to. Because designing across platforms requires having empathy for users with their platform in mind, becoming familiar with Material Design and the Android platform, along with differences between Android and iOS was core to the design process.
