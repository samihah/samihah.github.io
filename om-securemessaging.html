				<h1 id="projecttitle"><b>One Medical | Messaging</b></h1>
				<p class="description">I joined One Medical as a product designer on the consumer-facing team crafting thoughtful experiences for iOS, Android, and web. One of the first projects I worked on when I joined was messaging.</p>
				<p class="description"><strong>Project Goal:</strong> Improving the delivery of care through messaging</p>
				<p class="description"><strong>My Responsibilities:</strong> Research, definition, prototype, test, and design the UI and experience for Messaging.</p>
				<p class="description"><strong>Platforms I designed for:</strong> iOS, Android, web, and email</p>

			<h2>Intro</h2>
			<p class="description">I started the project by doing a deep dive on researching current consumer behavior on communicating clinical information to and from their doctors. I used the research to run a bodystorming exercise with a few teammates that helped expose a few serious holes with one of the directions we were looking at. We then used Slack as a means to prototype one of the approaches. I used our learnings from our creative prototyping sessions to create more traditional prototypes to test with users. We dedicated a full day of usability testing to test our three different approaches to messaging. This helped us learn what worked and what didn't in each of the prototypes.</p>

			<h2>Designing the UI, and Iterating Based on Learnings</h2>
			<p class="description">After going through numerous iterations, we split the work of designing the final deliverables between myself and one other designer on the consumer team. I designed the end-to-end experience on web and delivered the Android experience. For iOS, I worked on the iteration just after launch. We found the need to communicate to users if a provider was out of the office. I came up with a couple of options, and delivered the one that best addressed our need to communicate the proper SLA when a medical provider is out of the office. 
			<br><br>In addition to web, Android, and iOS, we also needed an email template to be used to notify users they have a message waiting for them in the app. I designed a few options and took the additional step of crafting a few copy options for subject line when a user views the message in their inbox.
			<br><br>Within a week of launching the new messaging feature to all of our markets, <strong>engagement went up by about 20x</strong> for Messaging! And two weeks after that, it continued <strong>growing by 30%!</strong></p>

			<h2>Customizing the Experience to the Platform</h2>
			<p class="description">The Android platform has its own patterns and conventions that Android users are accustomed to. Because designing across platforms requires having deep empathy for users with their platform in mind, becoming familiar with Material Design and the Android platform, along with differences between Android and iOS, were core to the design process.
