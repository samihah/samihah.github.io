						<span class="blurb-title">BACKGROUND &amp; CHALLENGE</span>
						<p class="blurb">We have two personas, both with unique needs: individual contributers, and VP/Manager level users. To meet both of their needs, we needed a lightweight project management component to our product that also tracked team velocity and performance. We also needed to improve our product goal of daily active use.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span class="blurb-title">MY ROLE</span>
						<p class="blurb">As Product Design Manager I'm responsible for all aspects of design:
							<ul class="blurb">
								<li>Execution of the UI and working with Engineering.</li>
								<li>Understand user needs which in turn feed into the product roadmap and feature prioritization.</li>
								<li>Set design language and designing the user experience, crafting the Playbooks UI, and iterating based on user learnings and behavior.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span class="blurb-title">LEARNINGS &amp; OUTCOME</span>
						<p class="blurb">After we had active users using the product, I started to track how they were using the product with a combination of data and qualitative research. This allows me to artfully balance both business goals and user goals. Our sales and customer base increased significantly, once this feature went live. We learned to refine our product development process so Design is ahead of Engineering, and developing product is more collaborative between all stakeholders.</p>

						<span class="blurb-title">BACKGROUND &amp; CHALLENGE</span>
						<p class="blurb">With Gleebox, there were three challenges:</p>
							<ul class="blurb">
								<li>1. creating a way to connect people to the local goods around them, and around the world</li>
								<li>2. connecting people to the businesses that sell these goods.</li>
								<li>3. We had to consider two types of users: consumers, and small business owners. Given the findings during the research phase and the greater vision for Gleebox, we focused on consumers first.</li>
							</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span class="blurb-title">MY ROLE</span>
						<p class="blurb">I defined the problem, spec'd out features, crafted the UI, and used a combination of qualitative and quantitative data to understand user behavior to optimize the experience, and iterate. I ran a cross-functional team managing engineering to ensure on-time delivery of product, and content marketing to ensure their content was timely and created loops back to the product.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span class="blurb-title">LEARNINGS &amp; OUTCOME</span>
						<p class="blurb">Mobile-first was the most optimal approach since it would allow users to upload content quickly, as well as connect with the business directly from the app. As a result, the primary focus was on designing the mobile app, with a supporting web component that connected to the in-app social feature. Based on my learnings, I determined the focus should be on consumers more than business owners.</p>

						<span class="blurb-title">BACKGROUND &amp; CHALLENGE</span>
						<p class="blurb">
							Ravenshire Castle was part of the Ravenworld games trilogy, which collectively had 4 million Monthly Active Users. The challenges I faced were as follows:
							<ul class="blurb">
							<li>Design of UI and UX needed to account for product goals AND user goals.</li>
							<li>Ensure our three game mechanics reinforced each other without sacrificing user experience.</li>
							<li>Internationalization: creating experiences that felt localized without changing the spirit of the game.</li>
							<li>Design an engaging tutorial (onboarding flow) that encourages repeat experiences</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span class="blurb-title">MY ROLE</span>
						<p class="blurb">
							As Lead Product Designer on Ravenshire Castle, I designed UI features to maximize for product goals of retention, monetization, and virality. I crafted UI elements that simplified the user experience for complex systems, created intuitive user flows, and identified and fixed UX flaws in our core game mechanics.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span class="blurb-title">LEARNINGS &amp; OUTCOME</span>
						<p class="blurb">A focus only on user goals or only on product goals can be detrimental to game play. The two must go hand in hand. The greates drop-off of users occurs during the tutorial phase. By creating a tutorial that feels like it's part of the product, I was able to keep users engaged with the game, which then kept them coming back.</p>
