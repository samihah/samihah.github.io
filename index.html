						<span class="blurb-title">BACKGROUND &amp; CHALLENGE</span>
						<p class="blurb">Our individual contributer users in the Customer Success team engage in activities that require interfacing with customers and others in their organization - and our VP/Manager level users need to keep track of team velocity and performance. To meet user needs, we needed a lightweight project management component to our product that did both. We also needed to increase our own daily active use. Because Playbooks would be centered around user workflow, it would pull users in everyday, thereby increasing retention and daily active use.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span class="blurb-title">MY ROLE</span>
						<p class="blurb">I do exploratory user research and contextual design studies to understand user needs which in turn feed into the product roadmap and feature prioritization. During a few of my sessions, I noticed ad-hoc methods of keeping track of tasks. Some CSM’s would use Post-its, others would use a notepad, and some CSM’s would use the “All Day” section of their Google Calendars. My approach was iterative and included feedback loops. I did the UX and designed the UI, and worked closely with Engineering on execution. I continued to iterate and refine the product based on customer feedback once it went live.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span class="blurb-title">LEARNINGS &amp; OUTCOME</span>
						<p class="blurb">After we had active users using the product, I started to track how they were using the product with a combination of data and qualitative research. As a result, I was able to artfully balance both business goals and user goals. Our sales and customer base increased significantly, purely on the need for this feature. We were also able to refine our product development process so that Design is always ahead of Engineering, and the effort to build and ship product is more collaborative between all stakeholders.</p>

						<div class="snippet">
							<span class="sniptitle">Research</span>
							<p class="sniptext">The research phase started before spec'ing out the features. I conducted user research and user interviews to understand user needs. Post-release, I did a few ethnographic studies to understand how the product was being used and at what frequency.</p>

							<span class="sniptitle">Wireframes &amp; Sketches</span>
							<p class="sniptext">Playbooks went through many iterations. I always start off sketching or whiteboarding ideas prior to high fidelity mocks. There were constant feedback and design reviews to refine Playbooks, even before Engineering started developing.</p>

							<p class="sniptext">Design is a process, so my job wasn't done once Playbooks was delivered to users. Once it was in the hands of users, I learned about how users were using Playbooks, additional needs, and edge cases that were previously unaccounted for. These learnings then went into more recent versions of Playbooks. </p>

						<span class="blurb-title">BACKGROUND &amp; CHALLENGE</span>
						<p class="blurb">With Gleebox, the challenge was two fold: 1. creating a way to connect people to the local goods around them, and around the world, and 2. connecting people to the businesses that sell these goods. Mobile-first was the most optimal approach since it would allow users to upload content quickly, as well as connect with the business directly from the app.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span class="blurb-title">MY ROLE</span>
						<p class="blurb">I defined the problem, spec'd out the features, and designed the UI. After launch, I used metrics to understand how users were behaving as well as conduct usability tests and user resarch to optimize the user experience, and iterate on the product. I ran a cross-functional team where I managed engineering to ensure on-time delivery of product, and content marketing to ensure their content was timely and created loops back to the product.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span class="blurb-title">LEARNINGS &amp; OUTCOME</span>
						<p class="blurb">After launch, I learned that users wanted a way to contact the business without having to look it up. To create this frictionless connection, I designed a feature allowing people to call businesses directly from the app, and grab their address. I also learned that there was more of a desire to share images with one's social circle than connect with others on the app - so a social share was released as well in the second version.</p>

						<span class="blurb-title">BACKGROUND &amp; CHALLENGE</span>
						<p class="blurb">Ravenshire Castle provided an interesting design challenge: the design absolutely must account for product goals of virality, monetization, or retention, as well as the user goal of being a fun, enjoyable experience. Collectively, the Ravenworld Games had 4 million Daily Active Users. With Ravenshire Castle, I had to ensure our three game mechanics reinforced each other without sacrificing user experience. I had the additional challenge of keeping internationalization in mind when designing, and understanding the many different types of demographics and users we had all over the world.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span class="blurb-title">MY ROLE</span>
						<p class="blurb">As Lead UI/UX Product Designer for Ravenshire Castle, I was responsible for ensuring the overarching macro-level user experience wasn't sacrificed and that the micro-level user experience for each of the three core game mechanics reinforced each other. In addition to designing the experience, I also worked with the visual designer on my team to design the UI and visual language. I also had to design for internationalization. A 3-letter word in English could potentially be 12 letters in Bahasa Indonesian. A metaphor in Western Europe could be wildly different in the Middle East.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span class="blurb-title">LEARNINGS &amp; OUTCOME</span>
						<p class="blurb">With Ravenshire Castle, it wasn't enough to ensure that users enjoyed the game - I also had to ensure that the design of the UI reinforced our product goals - and neither could sacrifice the other. By reinforcing our product goals, we could then create even more delightful features and experiences for our users. Prior to launch, I worked with Community to test Ravenshire with selected users from our other games. The feedback and learnings from those sessions fed into iterating and improving the gameplay experience and UI prior to public launch.</p>

							<span class="sniptitle">Research</span>
							<p class="sniptext">Most of the research was done by researching metaphors and keeping track of user metrics and behavior. Usability studies were a constant part of the development process and numerous solutions were always explored. I often pulled Engineering into discussions for insight into technical feasibility.</p>

						<div class="snippet">
							<span class="sniptitle">Wireframes &amp; Sketches</span>
							<p class="sniptext">Various solutions were sketched out and design reviews were frequent to minimize tunnel vision as well as to include feedback from the team. Initial ideas were sketched on whiteboards for quick changes. Lo-fi mocks were created to share with teams outside of design to receive feedback on functionality and user experience.</p>

							<span class="sniptitle">Iterate</span>
							<p class="sniptext">Iteration was done from the very beginning. Once there was some sort of minimal viable gameplay experience, I conducted frequent usability tests to ensure new users and existing users could easily play Ravenshire Castle without relying on the tutorial. I made any necessary changes prior to working with Engineering to hook up the functionality. </p>
