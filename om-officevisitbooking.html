				<h1 id="projecttitle"><b>One Medical | Integrated Office Visits Booking Flow</b></h1>
				<p class="description">One of the projects I led was creating a better care delivery experience. And with One Medical being a Google Ventures portfolio company, the GV Design Lab is available to us as a helpful resource. I met with two of the design partners about their Design Sprint process and best practices for facilitating a week-long Sprint. They also graciously came into One Medical before the Sprint to give a talk to the Product Development team and some of the Service Designers on the Sprint process. I facilitated the Sprint a week later. It was incredibly useful in having us focus on the right part of the problem. Out of the Sprint, we had three projects that spun out of it - two of which I can't discuss publically until it's in the hands of users, and the third is this project: Integrated Office Visits. </p>

			<p class="description">In working with the Data Team, we found that a significant portion of Office Visits were being booked by patients that could get their issue treated virtually. However, we had the additional challenge of designing with existing mental models in mind. Many patients still think of getting care in the context of an in-office experience, and are unaware that their issue could be treated virtually. One way to solve this is to tackle the problem upstream - before a user even selects the option to book an office visit. The other way to solve this, which is what we've done in Integrated Office Visits, is to gently guide the user when they've already selected Office Visits. This way, we are meeting them where they are and not fighting with an existing mental model.
			<br><br>To do this, we needed to capture the visit reason first. The first thing that I did was break down the information architecture of the existing flow, and recreate it to account for this need. After that, I worked closely with the Data Team and our Engineers in understanding tradeoffs in scope and feasibility with a few options for capturing the visit reason (ex: structured data vs unstructured data, etc etc). Once I had their input, I created a few options and spent 2 days going into the One Medical clinical office next door to HQ for quick guerrilla usability testing on a mobile device as well as paper prototyping with patients in the waiting room. Each time we had enough feedback, I would hop back into the office, iterate on the mocks, then pop back into the One Medical clinic for more testing. Everything from variations in layout, to icon, to copy was tested. Here's a screenshot of a small sample of the Invision prototypes created for this:</p>

			<p class="description">Each time we iterated and tested, it helped us validate core assumptions, as well as surprise us by questioning existing hypotheses. It also armed us with information when managing stakeholder desires. The end deliverable that I designed is below. We capture visit reason first where we list the two most common reasons that often do require an office visit, and then the 5 most common reasons a patient comes in when their issue could be treated virtually. Here are the screens for Integrated Office Visits: </p>

			<p class="description">Depending on what the user selects, they will either continue on to booking an office visit, or they will get dropped into the <a href="om-videovisits.html" target="blank_">Video Visits feature</a>. Here are screens for both of those flows:</p>
