				<p class="description">This project was one of three projects I led design on that spun out of a week long design sprint I facilitated. The sprint helped us focus on the right part of the problem. From the sprint, we had three projects that spun out of it - two of which cannot be discussed publicly until they're in the hands of users. The third is this project. </p>
				<p class="description"><strong>Project Goal:</strong> Crafting an improved care delivery experience and tying the virtual and office experiences</p>
				<p class="description"><strong>My Responsibilities:</strong> Research, information architecture, prototype, visual & UI design, product definition, interaction design</p>
				<p class="description"><strong>Platforms I designed for:</strong> iOS and Android</p>

			<h2>Intro</h2>
			<p class="description">In working with the Data Team, we found that a significant portion of Office Visits were being booked by patients that could get their issue treated virtually. However, we had the additional challenge of designing with existing mental models in mind, and for many patients, that meant getting care in an office. One way to solve this is to tackle the problem upstream - before a user even selects the option to book an office visit. The other way to solve this, which is what we've done in Integrated Office Visits, is to meet the user where they are and gently guide them towards receiving care virtually. 
			<h2>Reorganizing Information & Data-informed Design</h2>
			<p class="description">After the discovery phase, I broke down the information architecture of the existing flow, and remapped it so that we could start guiding users towards virtual care for acute issues. After that, I worked closely with the Data Team and our Engineers in understanding tradeoffs in scope and feasibility with a few options for capturing the visit reason (ex: structured data vs unstructured data, etc etc). Once I had their input, I created a few options and spent 2 days going into the One Medical clinical office next door to HQ for quick guerrilla usability testing on a mobile device as well as paper prototyping with patients in the waiting room. Each time we had enough feedback, I would hop back into the office, iterate on the mocks, then pop back into the One Medical clinic for more testing. Everything from variations in layout, to icon, to copy was tested. Here's a screenshot of a small sample of the Invision prototypes created for this:</p>

			<h2>Fast Feedback & Research Loops in UI Design Process</h2>
			<p class="description">Each time we iterated and tested, it helped us validate core assumptions, as well as surprise us by questioning existing hypotheses. It also armed us with information when managing stakeholder desires. The end deliverable that I designed is below. We capture visit reason first where we list the two most common reasons that often do require an office visit, and then the 5 most common reasons a patient comes in when their issue could be treated virtually. </p>

			<p class="description">Depending on what the user selects, they will either continue on to booking an office visit, or they will get dropped into the <a href="om-videovisits.html" target="blank_">Video Visits</a> experience. Here are screens for both of those flows:</p>
