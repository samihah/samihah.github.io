				<p class="description">I took an iOS for Designers class from <a href="https://codepath.com/" target="blank_">Codepath</a> as part of their Winter 2016 cohort. The class is free and meets after work twice a week for 8 grueling weeks to teach designers to code in Swift using Xcode. There's also a group project and at the end of the 8-weeks, the top three projects from each cohort (there's an Android for Engineers and iOS for Engineers class) move on to the public demo where we compete again within our cohort but by a panel of judges. My group got 1st place for our demo and we each ended up getting a Google Home out of it! (As well as a ton of learning). Below is the full demo of our iOS app, called Memoir. Memoir takes your still photos, and using the magic of augmented reality, brings your photos to life. We used the Vuforia API for the augmented reality. </p>

			<p class="description">While Xcode makes me want to flip all the tables, coding in Swift is a lot of fun! It's incredibly rewarding to bring my pixels to life in a higher fidelity native prototype. It's also much easier to understand scope and communicate with developers when you're all speaking the same language. For Memoir, all three of us were designers with some existing basic coding skills. When we were brainstorming project ideas, one of my team members was inspired by Harry Potter and had the idea to bring photos from a photo book to life. 
			<br><br>The idea was intriguing to me, but it inspired me to think about how personal photos are to us - especially when we frame them in our space. We used that as a starting point and spent a day sketching out numerous ideas together, created frameworks to make sense of the ideas and any potential market viability, then came up with Memoir - an idea that we were all incredibly excited about. As we listed out the features, we ended up cutting many of the nice-to-haves to limit scope creep. I designed the app and logo and then the three of us split the coding work by dividing the view controllers that we had to build.</p>
