				<p class="description">To learn native iOS development, I took the iOS for Designers class from <a href="https://codepath.com/" target="blank_">Codepath</a> where I learned to code in Swift using Xcode. As part of the class, there's a group project that gets presented. The top 3 go on to the public demo and present with the other cohorts. My team won 1st place for our app - and received a Google Home!. Below is the full demo of our iOS app, called Memoir. 
				<br><br>Memoir leverages hard copy photos, and using the magic of augmented reality, brings those photos to life. The augmented reality API that we used is Vuforia. </p>
				<p class="description"><strong>Project Goal:</strong> Learning to code native iOS apps using Swift and Xcode</p>
				<p class="description"><strong>My Responsibilities:</strong> Product definition, visual design, logo design, coding (swift)</p>
				<p class="description"><strong>Platforms I designed for:</strong> iOS</p>

			<p class="description">Unfortunately, Xcode can be a bit tempermental and often likes to crash, but programming in Swift is an incredible amount of fun. Knowing Swift and iOS development also helps when communicating with engineers and understanding scope. For Team Memoir, my teammates and I each had existing coding skills on a basic level. When brainstorming project ideas, one of my team members was inspired by Harry Potter and had the idea to bring photos from a photo book to life. 
			<br><br>The idea was intriguing to me and inspired me to think about how personal photos are to us - particularly when framing them in our space. We used that as a starting point and spent a day sketching numerous ideas and frameworks together. At the end of it, we came up with Memoir - an idea we were all incredibly excited about. While listing out the features, we ended up cutting many of the nice-to-haves to limit scope creep. I designed the app and logo and then the three of us split the Swift coding work by dividing the view controllers that we had to build.</p>
